# Clonan

Clonan is a simple text-based game where you write the code to rescue captives, kill enemies, and scale a tower. This is an adaptation of Ryanb's excellent [ruby-warrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior)

## Usage

lein run

This will demonstrate the first level. The code is only in demo mode at this point.

## Installation

git clone
